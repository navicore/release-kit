# Album Notes

*Concrete Frequencies* is an exploration of urban soundscapes through granular synthesis and field recordings from abandoned infrastructure.

## Process

All source material was recorded in decommissioned industrial sites across the Rust Belt. The recordings capture the ambient electromagnetic fields, mechanical resonances, and acoustic properties of these spaces in transition.

### Equipment

- Field recording: Soundfield ST450, contact microphones
- Synthesis: Bastl Kastle, Norns Shield (Cheat Codes 2)
- Post-production: Reaper with custom convolution reverbs

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the communities that preserve and document these spaces, and to the experimental music scene that continues to push boundaries.

Released November 2025.

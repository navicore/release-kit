Granular synthesis processing applied to 60Hz electrical hum captured through contact microphones on transformer housing. The piece explores the threshold between mechanical noise and tonal material.

## Technical Details

- Source: 96kHz/24-bit contact mic recording
- Processing: Granular synthesis with 50-200ms grains
- Convolution reverb derived from the same space's impulse responses
